## Summary
This script is dynamic enough to add modifications for it to fit a great number of datasets. For example, a more robust dataset could be introduced and add a few more lines for it to analyze  profoundly the data and get details that in this simple-3-column one we couldn't find. Another suggestion would be to asign each state the value given by the US electoral college, but this one may only be to federal elections.

Overall, this is a simple but useful script to overview the specifics of poll-based databases it is a good base to start from to analyze a large amount of data.
